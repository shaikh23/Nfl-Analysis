An assessment of the highest salaried players' impact upon their teams win percentage over time


For my project I will be going through several datasets and attempting to see whether the highest paid players in key positions have a significant impact, four or more wins the following year, on their teams win percentage. I will be drawing most of my data from kaggle.com. Key areas that will be assessed are did the team make their playoffs, did points scored/allowed increase or decrease? The null hypothesis for this experiment is that the highest paid players do not, on average, significantly alter their teams' win percentage.
