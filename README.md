# Nfl-Analysis
Do taller NFL players score more touchdowns and gain more yards than their peers? Do players with a higher body mass index(BMI) obtain more touchdowns and yards than their peers?


For my project I will be going through several datasets and attempting to see whether the taller and heavier players(measured by BMI) are statistically gaining more yards in specific statistics, e.g. QBR/YAC etc., than their shorter/smaller peers. I will be drawing most of my data from pro-football-reference.com and nfl.com.


# Background
Sports has always held a special place for me, with my favorite being football. I grew watching the NFL for many years as fan of the Philadelphia Eagles and enjoyed playing in games at my high school. One thing I noticed in my brief football career was that a large amount of the taller and larger players were scoring more touchdowns and gaining more yards than the rest of our team. So, I wanted to see if there is a similar trend at the professional level.

# Technologies Utilized
The tech stack I used was Python and Pandas to read and clean the information. Matplotlib along with Seaborn were used to visualize the data in plots and Scipy was used to run the statistical tests and determine the p-values for each test.


# Future Steps
Going forward I would like to analyze other positions to see if there is a trend between height/BMI and that position's
