# Nfl-Analysis
An assessment of the height/weight of NFL players against their statistical performances.


For my project I will be going through several datasets and attempting to see whether the taller and heavier players(measured by BMI) are statistically gaining more yards in specific statistics, e.g. QBR/YAC etc., than their shorter/smaller peers. I will be drawing most of my data from pro-football-reference.com and nfl.com.
