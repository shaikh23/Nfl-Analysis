# Nfl-Analysis
Do taller NFL players score more touchdowns and gain more yards than their peers? Do players with a higher body mass index(BMI) obtain more touchdowns and yards than their peers?


For my project I will be going through several datasets and attempting to see whether the taller and heavier players(measured by BMI) are statistically gaining more yards in specific statistics, e.g. QBR/YAC etc., than their shorter/smaller peers. I will be drawing most of my data from pro-football-reference.com and nfl.com.


# Background
Sports has always held a special place for me, with my favorite being football. I grew watching the NFL for many years as fan of the Philadelphia Eagles and enjoyed playing in games at my high school. One thing I noticed in my brief football career was that a large amount of the taller and larger players were scoring more touchdowns and gaining more yards than the rest of our team. So, I wanted to see if there is a similar trend at the professional level.

# Exploratory Data Analysis


# Results


# Technologies Utilized
Python, Pandas to read the information, Matplotlib/Seaborn to visualize the plots, and Scipy to run the statistical tests.


# Future Steps
Going forward I would like to analyze other positions to see if there is a trend between height/BMI and that position's
